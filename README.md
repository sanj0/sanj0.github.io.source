## Highlights

### [Salty Engine](https://github.com/sanj0/salty-engine)
Salty Engine, my long time passion project that slowly falls into oblivion and is infected with very old, very bad base code.

### [LT3](https://github.com/sanj0/lt3)
LT3 is the successor of Jess/Chessica. It consist of a simplistic, pragmatic chess UI and a mediocre AI. Move generation is 100% correct with perf of 1 and 2 and off by 1 node in perft(3) (as of 01. March 2021).
